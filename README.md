## Structure

Every chapter, article or a task has its folder.

The folder is named like `N-url`, where `N` is a number for the sorting purposes and `url` is the URL part with title of the material.

The type of the material is defined by the file inside the folder:

* `index.md` stands for a chapter
* `article.md` stands for an article
* `task.md` stands for a task \(solution must be provided in `solution.md` file aswell\)

Each of these files starts from the `# Main header`.

Assets required for the material reside in the same folder.
